- Node 12 / NPM 6

For a ready to use Docker environment with all prerequisites already installed and prepared, you can check out the [Docker environment](#docker-environment) section.

### Source code

Get a copy of the repository:

```bash
ToDo: git clone https://github.com/noi-techpark/project-name.git
```

Change directory:

```bash
ToDo: cd project-name/
```

### Dependencies

Download all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Build

Build and start the project:

```bash
npm run start
```

The application will be served and can be accessed at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Tests and linting

The tests and the linting can be executed with the following commands:

```bash
npm run test
npm run lint
```

## Deployment

To create the distributable files, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Docker environment

For the project a Docker environment is already prepared and ready to use with all necessary prerequisites.

These Docker containers are the same as used by the continuous integration servers.

### Installation

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (with Docker Compose) locally on your machine.

### Dependenices

First, install all dependencies:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app /bin/bash -c "npm install"
```

### Start and stop the containers

Before start working you have to start the Docker containers:

```
docker-compose up --build --detach
```

After finished working you can stop the Docker containers:

```
docker-compose stop
```

### Running commands inside the container

When the containers are running, you can execute any command inside the environment. Just replace the dots `...` in the following example with the command you wish to execute:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app /bin/bash -c "..."
```

Some examples are:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app /bin/bash -c "npm run test"
```
